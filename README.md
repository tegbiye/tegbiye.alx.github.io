# Ketari Online

## Introduction

The project was basically a hiring website where local labor offers their services and one can hire them by reviewing their ratings and location etc.

Keteri Online System is a web-based software designed to automate the
job search in a local market. The system allows clients to look at posted
jobs online if they want to hire a professional then they can just look at
the platform based on the rating. The system can be more efficient and
convenient for clients as hirers or job seekers to find jobs on the
platform. This in turn can make job searching experience good with
improved management and organization for the local job market.
